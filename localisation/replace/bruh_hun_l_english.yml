  HUN_political_crackdown:0 "Political Crackdown"
  HUN_political_crackdown_desc:0 "Horthy's government was far too loose on political dissenters. Though our policies may not be popular, they are for the good of Hungary. The people will accept this in time."

  HUN_form_paramilitaries_desc:0 "It is every man's duty to protect his family, and with the military's loyalties still in question, political paramilities are the only answer to the question of national defense."
