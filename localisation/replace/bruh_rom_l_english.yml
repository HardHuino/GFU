  ### EVENTS ###
  romania.7.t:0 "End of an Era?"
  romania.7.d:0 "The loss of Bessarabia and Bucovina to the Bolshevik Russians seems to have been the breaking point for the regime of Carol the Second. Several corruption scandals and the loss of North Transylvania and Dobrudja have left the King highly unpopular. Protests have broken out in Bucharest demanding the abdication of the King and the establishment of a new government.\n\nAmidst the chaos, the Iron Guard, A fascist organization led by Ion Antonescu, have seized control of all major government buildings in Bucharest, promising an end to the national humiliation, the reclaiming of old territory, and an end to the corruption of the monarchy. And, it seems that the police, the military command in Bucharest and the bureaucracy have, more or less without resistance, handed dictatorial powers to Antonescu on a silver platter.\n\nThe King has fled the country, his establishment either scrambling to do the same or to denounce him and swear loyalty to the new leader. A new day has dawned on the Kingdom of Romania, and the self-proclaimed “Conducător” will lead Romania down a path of revanchism, and ultimately, a path of war."
  romania.7.a:0 "Our fate is in our own hands."
